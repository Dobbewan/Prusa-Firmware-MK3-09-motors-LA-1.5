# Prusa-Firmware for OLED and 0.9 deg motors

Combined work by others: Mike Grozdanovic (OLED: lcd.cpp), Gerd Jentz (OLED: ultralcd.cpp) and Guy Kuo (0.9 deg motor)


# VFA fix summary, firmware compilation, and shopping list

VFA's are a solved issue with 0.9 degree stepper motors. This post is a summary of what is needed to use 0.9 degree motors.


## Firmware
You will need this 0.9 degree motor firmware (now includes BMG extruder support)

Be able to compile this firmware before doing any hardware changes. Once motors have been changed, the first thing you need to do is update the firmware to this 0.9 motor support version.

NEW on July 1 2019-
Extruder microstep rate has been reduced to avoid overrunning EINSY. E-steps are now 1/2 of what was needed for prior BNB firmware
Set e-steps to new values via terminal window.
-
PLEASE DO A FACTORY RESET WITH DATA ERASURE after installing this firmware. Failure to clear out old EEPROM setttings can produce odd printer behavior.

### Compiling my firmware for 0.9 degree motor support
You may wish to refer to the Prusa README.md document for more detailed instructions regarding compilation of the firmware. 
Warning: You are definitely in experimental firmware territory here.

#### Obtain Arduino IDE

Visit https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software and download the Arduino IDE for your OS. 
I successfully use Arduino 1.8.8 for OSX. 
Prusa instructions mention their internally using version 1.8.5
Install Arduino compiler on your computer

#### Prepare Arduino IDE to handle EINSY board
As downloaded, the Arduino IDE does not know about the EINSY RAMBO board. You must adjust some IDE settings to download board info from Ultimachine.

1. Launch Arduino.

2. In Preferences -> Settings Tab

Additional Boards Manager URLs textfield enter...
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultimachine/ArduinoAddons/master/package_ultimachine_index.json
```

3. Accept (OK) new preference setting

4. Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager
Select the RAMBo board, which is listed something like "RepRap Arduino-compabilty Mother Board (RAMBo) by Ultimachine"
Board info will download become noted as "Installed." Depending on server load this can take anywhere from seconds to minutes.

You many need to "update" the board to get the latest version. That is 1.0.1 as of this writing.

5. Close Board Manager

6. Tools -> Board, select RAMBo as target board. Do not select any other board.

7. QUIT Arduino IDE

8. Set compiler flags in platform.txt for newly installed RAMBo board
Use your OS file search function to find platform.txt

Under OSX, it will be in
```
~/Library/Arduino15/packages/rambo/hardware/avr/1.0.1
```
Open platform.txt

Add "-Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt -lm" to "compiler.c.elf.flags=" before existing flag "-Wl,--gc-sections"
On my system that meant adding the following line in platform.txt

```
compiler.c.elf.flags=-w -Os -Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt -lm -Wl,--gc-sections
```
Save your changes to platform.txt

#### Obtain firmware files.

0.9 degree motors require my firmware branch that contains 0.9 degree stepper support (which is this page)
https://github.com/guykuo/Prusa-Firmware/tree/0.9-Degree-Stepper-Support
Verify you are in my 0.9 Degree Stepper Support branch

Click on "Clone or Download" and DOWNLOAD ZIP to your computer

Unzip the newly downloaded Prusa-Firmware-0.9-Degree-Stepper-Support.zip

Inside the unzipped folder "Prusa-Firmware-0.9-Degree-Stepper-Support" you will find a folder named "Firmware"
That folder contains the firmware files you need. Place the firmware folder where you wish to keep it on your drive.

#### Set Printer Variant

Use the correct variant file for your printer model.
In Firmware/variants you will find several header (.h) files. Each printer model has one specific file.

Mk3 needs 1_75mm_MK3-EINSy10a-E3Dv6full.h

Mk3s needs 1_75mm_MK3S-EINSy10a-E3Dv6full.h

Choose the correct variant file for your printer model!!!!!!

Rename the variant file for your printer to be...

Configuration_prusa.h

Move Configuration_prusa.h to the main firmware folder. 


#### Set Language Support
Set language support in config.h to primary language only.
You MUST do this. Otherwise, firmware will not run properly. Instead, your LCD will display random letters and likely boot loop.

The changes needed are near bottom of the file. It should look like this...
```
//LANG - Multi-language support
#define LANG_MODE 0 // primary language only
//#define LANG_MODE 1 // sec. language support
#define LANG_SIZE_RESERVED 0x2f00 // reserved space for secondary language (12032 bytes)
```
You can make the edit from within Arduino IDE.


#### Set Motor Defines, Compile, Upload

My firmware branch includes changes for 0.9 degree motor support. All the important edits have been tagged with a comment.
Search for Kuo in all sketch tabs to view my changes.

For most users, you only need to specify which motors are 0.9 degree units.

1. Launch Arduino IDE

2. Open the Firmware.ino file which is inside your firmware folder

3. Select the Configuration_prusa.h tab

4. You must adjust defines in Configuration_prusa.h to match your actual motor setup for X Y and E axes. Also, if you have a BMG extruder,  uncomment #define BMG_EXTRUDER

Look for...

```
/*------------------------------------
 AXIS SETTINGS
 *------------------------------------*/
//Uncommented def(s) below specify 0.9 degree stepper motors on x, y, z, e axis
//Z is newly added and has not been tested with 0.9 motors
//Geared extruders now set for lower microstepping to avoid overruning EINSY during fast retracts or MMU2S filament moves. 
//Geared e-steps are consequently different from prior BNB 0.9 degree support firmware.

//Motors used should be 1 amp or lower current rating to avoid overheating TMC2130 drivers in Stealthchop.
//My recommended 0.9 degree motors for X, Y, or direct drive E are Moons MS17HA2P4100 or OMC 17HM15-0904S 
#define X_AXIS_MOTOR_09 //kuo exper X axis
#define Y_AXIS_MOTOR_09 //kuo exper Y axis
//#define Z_AXIS_MOTOR_09 //kuo exper Z axis
//#define E_AXIS_MOTOR_09 //kuo exper EXTRUDER
```

My _AXIS_MOTOR_09 defines are probably all you need to modify. The rest of my firmware changes are controlled by these defines.

Uncomment only the axes that you want to be 0.9 degree motors. For example, if you have 0.9 degree motors only on Y & Extruder and also use a BMG extruder it would look like...
```
//#define X_AXIS_MOTOR_09 //kuo exper X axis
#define Y_AXIS_MOTOR_09 //kuo exper Y axis
//#define Z_AXIS_MOTOR_09 //kuo exper Z axis
#define E_AXIS_MOTOR_09 //kuo exper EXTRUDER

#define BMG_EXTRUDER //Kuo Uncomment for BMG 3:1 extruder. This also sets BMG height for you. MUST also send M92 E415 & M500 to set esteps
//#define EXTRUDER_GEARRATIO_30 //Kuo Uncomment for extruder with gear ratio 3.0. MUST also send M92 E420 & M500 to set esteps
//#define EXTRUDER_GEARRATIO_3375 //Kuo Uncomment for extruder with gear ratio 3.375 like 54:16 BNBSX. MUST also send M92 E473 & M500 to set esteps
//#define EXTRUDER_GEARRATIO_35 //Kuo Uncomment for extruder with gear ratio 3.5 like 56:16 Bunny and Bear Short Ears or Skelestruder. MUST also send M92 E490 & M500 to set esteps

```



Save your changes

5. Test compile with Sketch -> Verify/Compile
Compiler will complete the job. 
If you see a warning about a missing bootloader, you probably have an older, RAMBo board 1.0.0 definition installed as your target board.

6. To compile and upload to the printer, connect your computer to the USB port of EINSY. 
Sketch -> Upload
The firmware will compile and upload to printer. Do NOT interrupt the update!!!! Let it complete.

You may also need to use Tools --> Port to select the correct USB port of your computer.





## Hardware
### Motors
Select either below listed Moons or OMC 0.9 degree steppers. Both dramatically reduce VFA's compared to any 1.8 degree motor. 

OMC motor is 1/2 cost of Moons but requires soldering of cable adapter. Moon's are plug-in compatible with Yotino cable harness.

Moon's are best at reducing VFA's with linearity correction OFF. They do not tune better with linearity correction.

OMC's are baseline slightly worse than Moons, but can be tuned to achieve better than Moons with linearity correction (1.130 - 1.140). However, forget to set linearity correction and the OMCs are worse than Moons. 

NB: Prusa firmware does not store linearity correction settings to EEPROM unless you let the menu time out by itself.

OMC's are a little bit louder during printing, but not by much. 

Both choices of motor require grinding a shaft flat for the y-axis.

It's a matter of cost, install effort, and whether one can be bothered to set linearity correction (once) for X and Y. Either motor choice greatly reduces VFA's.

### Heatsinks for TMC2130's
Obtain heatsinks for TMZ2130's x all 4 axes. May as well cool Z and E while taking care of X & Y)
Required to avoid 0.9 motors overheating TMC2130 drivers, especially if run in Stealth mode. Heatsinks attach to NON-COMPONENT side of EINSY PC board. They do NOT attach on the TMC2130 chips themselves, but to thermal vias on empty side of EINSY board. Must also cut holes in back of EINSY case for fitment & adequate ventilation. Clean PC board with IPA to let self-stick thermal tape do its job. Position on the vias!.

[Driver Heatsinks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GWR3TWZ)	$9
Driver Heatsinks for TMC2130 (12 pcs)
Use these or similar self-stick, driver heatsinks for stock EINSY enclosure. 

or

Reverse orientation EINSY case users must use low profile heatsinks because reverse case orients heatsinks towards heatbed. Extruder cable will catch on high profile heatsinks. Use low profile, Pi heatsinks.

[Raspberry Pi Heatsink Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07217N5LS)	$8
Raspberry Pi Heatsink Kit (lower profile than usual driver heatsinks)
I use these Pi heatsinks with my reverse EINSY case. Smaller and lower profile but still get the job done.

NB: if using retrograde motor extruder like BNBSX Short Ears, plug EINSY end in 180 degrees rotated
NB2: LDO's use different pinout not detailed here.

# Build
## Linux
Run shell script build.sh to build for MK3 and flash with Slic3er.  
If you have a different printer model, follow step [2.b](#2b) from Windows build first.  
If you wish to flash from Arduino, follow step [2.c](#2c) from Windows build first.  

The script downloads Arduino with our modifications and Rambo board support installed, unpacks it into folder PF-build-env-\<version\> on the same level, as your Prusa-Firmware folder is located, builds firmware for MK3 using that Arduino in Prusa-Firmware-build folder on the same level as Prusa-Firmware, runs secondary language support scripts. Firmware with secondary language support is generated in lang subfolder. Use firmware.hex for MK3 variant. Use firmware_\<lang\>.hex for other printers. Don't forget to follow step [2.b](#2b) first for non-MK3 printers.
## Windows
### Using Arduino
note: Multi language build is not supported.
#### 1. Development environment preparation

   a. install `"Arduino Software IDE"` for your preferred operating system  
`https://www.arduino.cc -> Software->Downloads`  
it is recommended to use version `"1.8.5"`, as it is used on out build server to produce official builds.  
_note: in the case of persistent compilation problems, check the version of the currently used C/C++ compiler (GCC) - should be `4.8.1`; version can be verified by entering the command  
`avr-gcc --version`  
if you are not sure where the file is placed (depends on how `"Arduino Software IDE"` was installed), you can use the search feature within the file system_  
_note: name collision for `"LiquidCrystal"` library known from previous versions is now obsolete (so there is no need to delete or rename original file/-s)_

   b. add (`UltiMachine`) `RAMBo` board into the list of Arduino target boards  
`File->Preferences->Settings`  
into text field `"Additional Boards Manager URLs"`  
type location  
`"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultimachine/ArduinoAddons/master/package_ultimachine_index.json"`  
or you can 'manually' modify the item  
`"boardsmanager.additional.urls=....."`  
at the file `"preferences.txt"` (this parameter allows you to write a comma-separated list of addresses)  
_note: you can find location of this file on your disk by doing the following:  
`File->Preferences->Settings`  (`"More preferences can be edited in file ..."`)_  
then choose 
`Tools->Board->BoardsManager`  
from viewed list and select the item labeled `"RAMBo"` (will probably be labeled as `"RepRap Arduino-compatible Mother Board (RAMBo) by UltiMachine"`  
_note: select this item for any variant of board used in printers `'Prusa i3 MKx'`, that is for `RAMBo-mini x.y` and `EINSy x.y` to_  
'clicking' the item will display the installation button; select choice `"1.0.1"` from the list(last known version as of the date of issue of this document)  
_(after installation, the item is labeled as `"INSTALLED"` and can then be used for target board selection)_  

   c. modify platform.txt to enable float printf support:  
add "-Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt -lm" to "compiler.c.elf.flags=" before existing flag "-Wl,--gc-sections"  
example:  
`"compiler.c.elf.flags=-w -Os -Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt -lm -Wl,--gc-sections"`
The file can be found in Arduino instalation directory, or after Arduino has been updated at:  
"C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\arduino\hardware\avr\(version)"
If you can locate the file in both places, file from user profile is probably used.

#### 2. Source code compilation

a. place the source codes corresponding to your printer model obtained from the repository into the selected directory on your disk  
`https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/`  

b.<a name="2b"></a> In the subdirectory `"Firmware/variants/"` select the configuration file (`.h`) corresponding to your printer model, make copy named `"Configuration_prusa.h"` (or make simple renaming) and copy it into `"Firmware/"` directory.  

c.<a name="2c"></a> In file `"Firmware/config.h"` set LANG_MODE to 0.

run `"Arduino IDE"`; select the file `"Firmware.ino"` from the subdirectory `"Firmware/"` at the location, where you placed the source code  
`File->Open`  
make the desired code customizations; **all changes are on your own risk!**  

select the target board `"RAMBo"`  
`Tools->Board->RAMBo`  
_note: it is not possible to use any of the variants `"Arduino Mega …"`, even though it is the same MCU_  

run the compilation  
`Sketch->Verify/Compile`  

upload the result code into the connected printer  
`Sketch->Upload`  

or you can also save the output code to the file (in so called `HEX`-format) `"Firmware.ino.rambo.hex"`:  
`Sketch->ExportCompiledBinary`  
and then upload it to the printer using the program `"FirmwareUpdater"`  
_note: this file is created in the directory `"Firmware/"`_  

### Using Linux subsystem under Windows 10 64-bit
_notes: Script and instructions contributed by 3d-gussner. Use at your own risk. Script downloads Arduino executables outside of Prusa control. Report problems [there.](https://github.com/3d-gussner/Prusa-Firmware/issues) Multi language build is supported._
- follow the Microsoft guide https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
  You can also use the 'prepare_winbuild.ps1' powershell script with Administrator rights
- Tested versions are at this moment
  - Ubuntu other may different
  - After the installation and reboot please open your Ubuntu bash and do following steps
  - run command `apt-get update`
  - to install zip run `apt-get install zip`
  - add few lines at the top of `~/.bashrc` by running `sudo nano ~/.bashrc`
	
	export OS="Linux"
	export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"
	export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
	
	use `CRTL-X` to close nano and confirm to write the new entries
  - restart Ubuntu bash
Now your Ubuntu subsystem is ready to use the automatic `PF-build.sh` script and compile your firmware correctly

#### Some Tips for Ubuntu
- Linux is case sensetive so please don't forget to use capital letters where needed, like changing to a directory
- To change the path to your Prusa-Firmware location you downloaded and unzipped
  - Example: You files are under `C:\Users\<your-username>\Downloads\Prusa-Firmware-MK3`
  - use under Ubuntu the following command `cd /mnt/c/Users/<your-username>/Downloads/Prusa-Firmware-MK3`
    to change to the right folder
- Unix and windows have different line endings (LF vs CRLF), try dos2unix to convert
  - This should fix the `"$'\r': command not found"` error
  - to install run `apt-get install dos2unix`

#### Compile Prusa-firmware with Ubuntu Linux subsystem installed
- open Ubuntu bash
- change to your source code folder (case sensitive)
- run `./PF-build.sh`
- follow the instructions

### Using Git-bash under Windows 10 64-bit
_notes: Script and instructions contributed by 3d-gussner. Use at your own risk. Script downloads Arduino executables outside of Prusa control. Report problems [there.](https://github.com/3d-gussner/Prusa-Firmware/issues) Multi language build is supported._
- Download and install the 64bit Git version https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Also follow these instructions https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058
- Download and install 7z-zip from its official website https://www.7-zip.org/
  By default, it is installed under the directory /c/Program Files/7-Zip in Windows 10
- Run `Git-Bash` under Administrator privilege
- navigate to the directory /c/Program Files/Git/mingw64/bin
- run `ln -s /c/Program Files/7-Zip/7z.exe zip.exe`

#### Compile Prusa-firmware with Git-bash installed
- open Git-bash
- change to your source code folder
- run `bash PF-build.sh`
- follow the instructions

# 4. Documentation
run [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) in Firmware folder

# 5. FAQ
Q:I built firmware using Arduino and I see "?" instead of numbers in printer user interface.

A:Step 1.c was ommited or you updated Arduino and now platform.txt located somewhere in your user profile is used.

Q:I built firmware using Arduino and printer now speaks Klingon (nonsense characters and symbols are displayed @^#$&*°;~ÿ)

A:Step 2.c was omitted.

Q:What environment does Prusa use to build the firmware in the first place?

A:Our production builds are 99.9% equivalent to https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware#linux this is also easiest way to build as only one step is needed - run single script, which downloads patched Arduino from github, builds using it, then extracts translated strings and creates language variants (for MK2x) or language hex file for external SPI flash (MK3x). But you need Linux or Linux in virtual machine. This is also what happens when you open pull request to our repository - all variants are built by Travis http://travis-ci.org/ (to check for compilation errors). You can see, what is happening in .travis.yml. It would be also possible to get hex built by travis, only deploy step is missing in .travis.yml. You can get inspiration how to deploy hex by travis and how to setup travis in https://github.com/prusa3d/MM-control-01/ repository. Final hex is located in ./lang/firmware.hex Community reproduced this for Windows in https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware#using-linux-subsystem-under-windows-10-64-bit or https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware#using-git-bash-under-windows-10-64-bit .

Q:Why are build instructions for Arduino mess.

Y:We are too lazy to ship proper board definition for Arduino. We plan to swich to cmake + ninja to be inherently multiplatform, easily integrate build tools, suport more IDEs, get 10 times shorter build times and be able to update compiler whenewer we want.
